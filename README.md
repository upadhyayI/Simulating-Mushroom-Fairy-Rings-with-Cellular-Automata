# Simulating Mushroom Fairy Rings with Cellular Automata

The main .R file to explore the simulation with is FairyMushroomExplorer.R. This program is a Shiny app, allowing the user to adjust parameters and view how this adjustment impacts the simulation. It contains several of the additional scenarios as well.

Enclosed are also several .R files for those different scenarios:

*Mushroom Project ObstructionModel* - simulates growth of fungi around obstacles

*MGG modified neighborhood* - modifies probability for spreading diagonally, to obtain more circular growth patterns

*Mushroom Probabilistic Death* - makes death time probabilistic with an adjustable rate

*Two Mushroom Species* - simulates two separate species growing in the same region
