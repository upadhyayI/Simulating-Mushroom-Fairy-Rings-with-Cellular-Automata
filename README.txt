The main .R file to explore the simulation with is FairyMushroomExplorer.R. This program is a Shiny app, allowing the user to adjust parameters and view how this adjustment impacts the simulation. It contains several of the additional scenarios discussed in our presentation as well.

Enclosed are also several .R files for those different scenarios:

CSE616_MushroomProject_ObstructionModel.R - simulates growth of fungi around obstacles

MGG_modified_neighborhood.R - modifies probability for spreading diagonally, to obtain more circular growth patterns

mushroomProbabilisticDeath.R - makes death time probabilistic with an adjustable rate

TwoMushroomSpecies.R - simulates two separate species growing in the same region
